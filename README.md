ConfigMaps 

There are different ways to use configMaps in kubernetes clusters

Use ConfigMaps Inside Pods: As Environment Variables

examples: myapp-full-container.yaml and myapp-specific-container.yaml

Use ConfigMaps Inside Pods: As Volumes
Volume plugin converts the ConfigMap object into a mountable resource
